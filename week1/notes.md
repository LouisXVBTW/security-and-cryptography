# Week 1
i need to re-watch and make notes this time

## Task 1
Design a single cryptographic data structure (a crypto message), which solves the 
following riddle: 
 
1. The message is only readable to Bob 
2. The message contains multiple parts, and one of them originated from Alice, 
however another part could have originated from either Bob or a third-party 
server 
3. Even though we know that the part that originated from Alice contains the 
string “hello life”, we cannot read that string 
4. Only Bob knows the part that originated from Alice 
5. There are “at most”, four encryptions in the message
